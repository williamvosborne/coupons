  # Define the token generator. By default it uses

  # You can create a custom generator by defining an object that responds to to
  # `call` and receives a hash of options.

  #     config.generator = proc do |options|

  # Define the record resolver.
  # When you create a coupon, you can associate it with any record.
  # This is useful for creating coupons tied to a specific product or category.
  #
  # The object must implement the methods `load` and `dump`.
  # The `load` method will receive a signature generated by `dump`.
  #
  # By default it uses the `globalid` gem.
